<p>Numerical methods - at the moment all in c - for measuring the area under a curve.</p>
<p>Each method integrates the curve f(x) = 5x^3 - 12x^2 + 7x - 3, and the
integration is carried out from x = 2 to x = 6.</p>
<p>The analytic answer is area = 868.00</p>
<p>The eight methods represented here are the eight Newton-Cotes formulae - four open and four closed.</p>
<p>The trapezoid rule is the first degree closed Newton-Cotes formula.</p>
<p>Simpson's rule is the second degree closed Newton-Cotes formula.</p>
<p>Simpson's 3/8 rule is the third degree closed Newton-Cotes formula.</p>
<p>Boole's rule is the fourth degree closed Newton-Cotes formula.</p>
<p>The rectangle rule is the second degree open Newton-Cotes formula.</p>
<p>The trapezoid method is the third degree open Newton-Cotes formula.</p>
<p>Milne's rule is the fourth degree open Newton-Cotes formula.</p>
<p>The fifth degree open Newton-Cotes formula has no name, and is in the program noname.c</p>
